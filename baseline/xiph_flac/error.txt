[-] Oops, the program crashed with one of the test cases provided. There are
    several possible explanations:

    - The test case causes known crashes under normal working conditions. If
      so, please remove it. The fuzzer should be seeded with interesting
      inputs - but not ones that cause an outright crash.

    - The current memory limit (50.0 MB) is too low for this program, causing
      it to die due to OOM when parsing valid files. To fix this, try
      bumping it up with the -m setting in the command line. If in doubt,
      try something along the lines of:

      ( ulimit -Sv $[49 << 10]; /path/to/binary [...] <testcase )

      Tip: you can use http://jwilk.net/software/recidivm to quickly
      estimate the required amount of virtual memory for the binary. Also,
      if you are using ASAN, see /usr/local/share/doc/afl/notes_for_asan.txt.

    - Least likely, there is a horrible bug in the fuzzer. If other options
      fail, poke <lcamtuf@coredump.cx> for troubleshooting tips.
