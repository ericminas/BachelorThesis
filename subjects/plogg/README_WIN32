Building plogg on win32 with Visual Studio 2005
===============================================

The following are also required but included as submodules:

  - libogg
  - libtheora
  - libvorbis
  - libsydneyaudio

First retrieve the thirdparty submodules:

  $ git clone git://github.com/doublec/plogg.git
  $ cd plogg
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update

plogg also requires SDL to build. Download the SDL development library
at www.libsdl.org, e.g:
http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.13-VC8.zip

Extract the SDL-devel library, and copy the contents of the SDL-devel
include/ directory into plogg/thirdparty/SDL/include/SDL .
Copy the SDL-devel lib directory to plogg/thirdparty/SDL.lib .

Once all the thirdparty libraries are downloaded, you can build everything
with the plogg solution file in win32/VS2005/plogg.sln.

You'll need to copy SDL.dll from the SDL-devel/lib directory into the same 
directory as your plogg.exe, or into C:\Windows\System32.
