<p>
  Reading data from an Ogg file is relatively simple. The file format
  is well documented
  in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3533.txt">RFC 3533</a>. I
  showed how to read the format using
  JavaScript <a href="http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2009/06/reading-ogg-files-with-javascript.html">
    in a previous post</a>.
</p>
<p>For C and C++ programs it's easier to use
  the <a href="http://xiph.org">xiph.org</a> libraries. There are
  libraries for decoding specific formats (libvorbis, libtheora) and
  there is a library for reading data from Ogg files (libogg).
</p>
<p>I'm prototyping some approaches to improve the performance of the
  Firefox Ogg video playback and while I'm at it I'll write some posts
  on using these libraries to decode/play Ogg files. Hopefully it'll
  prove useful to others using them and I can get some feedback on
  usage.
</p>
<p>All the code for this is in
  the <a href="http://github.com/doublec/plogg/tree">plogg</a> git
  repository on github. The 'master' branch contains the work in
  progress player that I'll describe in a series of posts, and there
  are branches specific to the examples in each post.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/">libogg
    documentation</a> describes the API that I'll be using in this
    post. All that this example will do is read an Ogg file, read each
    stream in the file and count the number of packets for that
    stream. It prints the number of packets. It doesn't decode the
    data or do anything really useful. That'll come later.
</p>
<p>You can think of an Ogg file as containing logical streams of
  data. Each stream has a serial number that is unique within the file
  to identify it. A file containing Vorbis and Theora data will have
  two streams. A Vorbis stream and a Theora stream.</p>
<p>Each stream is split up into packets. The packets
  contain the raw data for the stream. The process of decoding a
  stream involves getting a packet from it, decoding that data, doing
  something with it, and repeating.</p>
<p>That describes the logical format. The physical format of the Ogg
  file is split into pages of data. Each physical page contains some
  part of the data for one stream. </p>
<p>The process of reading and decoding an Ogg file is to read pages
  from the file, associating them with the streams they belong to. At
  some point we then go through the pages held in the stream and
  obtain the packets from it. This is the process the code in this
  example follows.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do when reading an Ogg file is find the
first page of data. We use
  a <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_sync_state.html">ogg_sync_state</a>
  structure to keep track of search for the page data. This needs to
  be initialized
  with <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_sync_init.html">ogg_sync_init</a>
  and later cleaned up
  with <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_sync_clear.html">ogg_sync_clear</a>:
<pre>ifstream file("foo.ogg", ios::in | ios::binary);
ogg_sync_state state;
int ret = ogg_sync_init(&state);
assert(ret==0);
...look for page...
</pre>
<p>Note that the libogg functions return an error code which should be
  checked, A result of '0' generally indicates success. We want to
  obtain a complete page of Ogg data. This is held in
  an <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_page.html">ogg_page</a>
  structure. The process of obtaining this structure is to do the
  following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Call <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_sync_pageout.html">ogg_sync_pageout</a>. This
  will take any data current stored in the ogg_sync_state object and
  store it in the ogg_page. It will return a result indicating when
  the entire pages data has been read and the ogg_page can be used. It
  needs to be called first to initialize buffers. It gets called
  repeatedly as we read data from the file.</li>
  <li>Call <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_sync_buffer.html">ogg_sync_buffer</a>
  to obtain an area of memory we can reading data from the file
  into. We pass the size of the buffer. This buffer is reused
  on each call and will be resized if needed if a larger buffer size
  is asked for later.</li>
  <li>Read data from the file into the buffer obtained above.</li>
  <li>Call <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_sync_wrote.html">ogg_sync_wrote</a>
  to tell libogg how much data we copied into the buffer.</li>
  <li>Resume from the first step, calling ogg_sync_buffer. This will
  copy the data from the buffer into the page, and return '1' if a
  full page of data is available.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the code following these steps:</p>
<pre>ogg_page page;
while(ogg_sync_pageout(&amp;state, &amp;page) != 1) {
  char* buffer = ogg_sync_buffer(oy, 4096);
  assert(buffer);

  file.read(buffer, 4096);
  int bytes = stream.gcount();
  if (bytes == 0) {
    // End of file
    break;
  }

  int ret = ogg_sync_wrote(&state, bytes);
  assert(ret == 0);
}
</pre>
<p>We need to keep track of the logical streams within the file. These
  are identified by serial number and this number is obtained from the
  page. I create a C++ map to associate the serial number with an
  OggStream object which holds information I want associated with the
  stream. In later examples this will hold data needed for the Theora
  and Vorbis decoding process.
</p>
<pre>class OggStream
{
  ...
  int mSerial;
  ogg_stream_state mState;
  int mPacketCount;
  ...
};

typedef map<int, OggStream*> StreamMap; 
</pre>
<p>Each stream has
  an <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_stream_state.html">ogg_stream_state</a>
  object that is used to keep track of the data read that belongs to
  the stream. We're storing this in the OggStream object that we
  associated with the stream serial number. Once we've read a page as
  described above we need to tell libogg to add this page of data to
  the stream.
</p>
<pre>
StreamMap streams;
ogg_page page = ...obtained previously...;
int serial = ogg_page_serialno(&page);
OggStream* stream = 0;
if (ogg_page_bos(&page) {
  stream = new OggStream(serial);
  int ret = ogg_stream_init(&stream->mState, serial);
  assert(ret == 0);
  streams[serial] = stream;
}
else
  stream = streams[serial];

int ret = ogg_stream_pagein(&stream->mState, &page);
assert(ret == 0);
</pre>

<p>This code
  uses <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_page_serialno.html">ogg_page_serialno</a>
  to get the serial number of the page we just read. If it is the
  beginning of the stream
  (<a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_page_bos.html">ogg_page_bos</a>)
  then we create a new OggStream object, initialize the stream's state
  with <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_stream_init.html">ogg_stream_init</a>,
  and store it in out streams map. If it's not the beginning of the
  stream we just get our existing entry in the map. The final call to
  <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_stream_pagein.html">ogg_stream_pagein</a>
  inserts the page of data into the streams state object. Once this is
  done we can start looking for completed packets of data and decode them. 
</p>
<p>To decode the data from a stream we need to retrieve a packet from
  it. The steps for doing this are:<p>
<ul>
  <li>Call <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_stream_packetout.html">ogg_stream_packetout</a>. This
  will return a value indicating if a packet of data is available in
  the stream. If it is not then we need to read another page
  (following the same steps previously) and add it to the stream,
  calling ogg_stream_packetout again until it tells us a packet is
  available. The packet's data is stored in
  an <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/ogg_packet.html">ogg_packet</a>
  object.</li>
  <li>Do something with the packet data. This usually involves calling
  libvorbis or libtheora routines to decode the data. In this example
  we're just counting the packets.</li>
  <li>Repeat until all packets in all streams are consumed.</li>
</ul>
<pre>while (..read a page...) {
  ...put page in stream...  
  ogg_packet packet;
  int ret = ogg_stream_packetout(&stream->mState, &packet);	
  if (ret == 0) {
    // Need more data to be able to complete the packet
    continue;
  }
  else if (ret == -1) {
    // We are out of sync and there is a gap in the data.
    // We lost a page somewhere.
    break;
  }

  // A packet is available, this is what we pass to the vorbis or
  // theora libraries to decode.
  stream->mPacketCount++;
}
</pre>
<p>That's all there is to reading an Ogg file. There are more libogg
  functions to get data out of the stream, identify end of stream, and
  various other useful functions but this covers the basics. Try out
  the example program in the github repository for more information.
</p>
<p>Note that the libogg functions don't require reading from a
  file. You can use these routines with any data you've obtained. From
  a socket, from memory, etc.</p>
<p>In the next post about reading Ogg files I'll go through using
  libtheora to decode the video data and display it.</p>
